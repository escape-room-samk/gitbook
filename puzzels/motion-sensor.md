# Motion Sensor

## Story

The user will be in front of the Kinnect and his colleague will tell him the different letters he sees from the maze. He will have to look on the alphabet signboard to make the exact position corresponding to each letter and he will have to stay three seconds in each position to save the letter. To send the data he will have to make a special position \(arms up\) during three seconds after the entire word.

Kinect for Windows is versatile. It can see people’s full body movement as well as small hand gestures. Up to xix people can be tracked as whole skeletons. The Kinect for Windows v2 Sensor has an RGB \(red-green-blue\) camera for color video, and an infrared emitter and camera that measure depth in millimeter resolutions. The Kinect for Windows v2 Sensor enables a wide variety of interactions, but any sensor has “sweet spots” and limitations.

This little black box contains multiple features that allow gamers to be the controller and feel as if they are actually in the game. When we heard about this sensor giving players' the ability to transform their entire bodies into a game controller, we were convinced that we just had to investigate what really goes on inside of this revolutionary device.

#### Body limits : 

•0.5m to 4.5m \(default\)

•Sweet spot: 0.8m to 3.5m

• The depth sensor can also see from 4.5m to 8m, but body detection does not work in this extended range.

#### Angles limits :

Horizontal: 70 degrees

• Vertical: 60 degrees

## Software :

The software is what makes the Kinect a breakthrough device. Developers for the Kinect gathered an incredible amount of data regarding motion-capture of actual moving things in real-life scenarios. Processing all of this data using a special artificial intelligence machine-learning algorithm allows the Kinect to map the visual data it collects to models representing people of different backgrounds \(age, height, gender, body type, clothing and more\). This is just one of the ways that developers were able to help the Kinect "learn" about its surroundings and what it is actually seeing.

The Kinect's "brain" is really the secret. Stored in the system is enough intelligence to analyze what it sees and align that with stored collection of skeletal structures to interpret your movements. Once the brain has enough data on your body parts, it outputs this reference data into a simplified 3D avatar shape. Beyond gauging player movements, the Kinect must also judge the distances of different points on your body throughout the entire game. To do this it uses a host of sensors and analyzes all this data 30 times a second.

## Hardware :

The Kinect contains three vital pieces that work together to detect your motion and create your physical image on the screen: an RGB color VGA video camera, a depth sensor, and a multi-array microphone.

The camera detects the red, green, and blue color components as well as body-type and facial features. It has a pixel resolution of 1920x1080 and a frame rate of 30 fps. This helps in facial recognition and body recognition.

The depth sensor contains a monochrome CMOS sensor and infrared projector that help create the 3D imagery throughout the room. It also measures the distance of each point of the player's body by transmitting invisible near-infrared light and measuring its "time of flight" after it reflects off the objects.

These components come together to detect and track 48 different points on each player's body and repeats 30 times every second.
