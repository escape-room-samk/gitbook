# Motion Sensor

## Story

The user will be in front of the Kinnect and his colleague will tell him the different letters he sees from the maze. He will have to look on the alphabet signboard to make the exact position corresponding to each letter and he will have to stay three seconds in each position to save the letter. To send the data he will have to make a special position \(arms up\) during three seconds after the entire word.
