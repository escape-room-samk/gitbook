# RFID Reader

## Story

The user will have to find the different RFID cards, which are hidden in the room, and he will have to present them in front of the RFID reader. There are different cards in the room so the user will have to find the correct one by testing them in front of the RFID reader. 

RFID is an acronym for “radio-frequency identification” and refers to a technology whereby digital data encoded in RFID tags or smart labels \(defined below\) are captured by a reader via radio waves. RFID is similar to barcoding in that data from a tag or label are captured by a device that stores the data in a database. RFID, however, has several advantages over systems that use barcode asset tracking software. The most notable is that RFID tag data can be read outside the line-of-sight, whereas barcodes must be aligned with an optical scanner. If you are considering implementing an RFID solution, take the next step and contact the RFID experts at AB&R® \(American Barcode and RFID\).

RFID belongs to a group of technologies referred to as Automatic Identification and Data Capture \(AIDC\). AIDC methods automatically identify objects, collect data about them, and enter those data directly into computer systems with little or no human intervention. RFID methods utilize radio waves to accomplish this. At a simple level, RFID systems consist of three components: an RFID tag or smart label, an RFID reader, and an antenna. RFID tags contain an integrated circuit and an antenna, which are used to transmit data to the RFID reader \(also called an interrogator\). The reader then converts the radio waves to a more usable form of data. Information collected from the tags is then transferred through a communications interface to a host computer system, where the data can be stored in a database and analyzed at a later time.[PreviousMotion](https://auxiliary.gitbook.io/project/)Was this page helpful?Let us know how we did
