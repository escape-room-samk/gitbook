# RFID Reader

## Story

There are different RFID cards in the room which are hidden. The user will have to find them and he will have to present them in front of the RFID reader to see which ones are the correct one by testing them thanks to the RFID reader. 

RFID is an acronym for “radio-frequency identification” and refers to a technology whereby digital data encoded in RFID tags or smart labels \(defined below\) are captured by a reader via radio waves. RFID is similar to barcoding in that data from a tag or label are captured by a device that stores the data in a database. RFID, however, has several advantages over systems that use barcode asset tracking software. The most notable is that RFID tag data can be read outside the line-of-sight, whereas barcodes must be aligned with an optical scanner. If you are considering implementing an RFID solution, take the next step and contact the RFID experts at AB&R® \(American Barcode and RFID\).

RFID belongs to a group of technologies referred to as Automatic Identification and Data Capture \(AIDC\). AIDC methods automatically identify objects, collect data about them, and enter those data directly into computer systems with little or no human intervention. RFID methods utilize radio waves to accomplish this. At a simple level, RFID systems consist of three components: an RFID tag or smart label, an RFID reader, and an antenna. RFID tags contain an integrated circuit and an antenna, which are used to transmit data to the RFID reader \(also called an interrogator\). The reader then converts the radio waves to a more usable form of data. Information collected from the tags is then transferred through a communications interface to a host computer system, where the data can be stored in a database and analyzed at a later time.[PreviousMotion](https://auxiliary.gitbook.io/project/)Was this page helpful?Let us know how we did  


## Materials 

### RFID reader

This RC522 RFID Kit includes a 13.56MHz RF reader module that uses an RC522 IC and two S50 RFID cards to help you learn and add the 13.56 MHz RF transition to your project. The MF RC522 is a highly integrated transmission module for contact-less communication at 13.56 MHz. RC522 supports ISO 14443A/MIFARE mode.  
 The module uses SPI to communicate with microcontrollers. The open-hardware community already has a lot of projects exploiting the RC522 – RFID Communication, using Arduino.

### Raspberry Pi 3B

The **Raspberry Pi** is a series of small [single-board computers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-board_computer) developed in the [United Kingdom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom) by the [Raspberry Pi Foundation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raspberry_Pi_Foundation) to promote teaching of basic [computer science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_science) in schools and in [developing countries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developing_countries).The original model became far more popular than anticipated,[\[8\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raspberry_Pi#cite_note-1000x-8) selling outside its [target market](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Target_market) for uses such as [robotics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robotics). It does not include peripherals \(such as [keyboards](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keyboard_%28computing%29) and [mice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouse_%28computing%29)\) and [cases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_case). However, some accessories have been included in several official and unofficial bundles.[\[8\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raspberry_Pi#cite_note-1000x-8)
