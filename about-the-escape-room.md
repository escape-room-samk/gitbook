## Background information and objectives.

The Satakunta University of Applied Sciences is interested in making an escape room. So, we were given the project, and we were asked to use robots and new technologies. We just had to make the puzzles, not build the entire room, since the location of the room is not clear yet.

Our task was to create different puzzles using robots and new technologies that are availables in the university. We were given free mind and no limits to make the puzzles. So first of all, we made a brainstorming, where we write down all the ideas, no matter if they were possible, difficult or we didn’t have the knowledge to do them. So after that, we think about them, select the ones that we were able to build and show, and each one took one idea to create it. As we are five different students, and we are specialiced in different engineering areas, we can help each other in case that any of us is stuck.

We are a group of five Erasmus students from Spain \(Jaime and Jose\) and Belgium \(Sybren, Colin and Nicolas\) in the last years of our degrees. 

Jaime and Jose are studying electronics engineering. Jose is in the fourth year and Jaime in the third year. Sybren and Colin are studying information technology and they are in the third year. Nicolas is studying electromechanics and he is in the third year. 



## Scope of the project and task. 



Jose and Jaime are going to be the project managers, since they have been in the Robotics Academy in the Autumn term. They will be in charge of the project plan. They will take the decisions related to the whole project.

All the puzzles involve different tasks, so in case that any of us needs help, all the team can help him, but the idea is that each one works in his own puzzle. There is a support team compound by teachers from SAMK that will help us in case that we need something or if we are lost and we don’t know how to continue.
