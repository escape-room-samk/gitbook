# Agenda

In this paragraph is found the projected schedule. In the part of tasks is explained how we worked, what changes we have done and the problems that we found.

The projected schedule doesn't reflects the real schedule. There have been different changes that made us to have a different schedule. In any case, the project is finished in the same dates as we expected.
