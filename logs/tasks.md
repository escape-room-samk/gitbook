# Tasks

## Week 6. 

\[04/02/2018-08/02/2018\]

### Brainstorming

we decided to spend enough time to see as many different ideas as possible. So we used the brainstorming to collect them and write them down. Finally we select the most original and achievable ones.

### Allbot \(Nicolas & Jaime\)

In the first week, we receive the project, made a brainstorming to see what ideas can be done and we select the best ones. We divided the tasks and the puzzles. As the Allbot uses Arduino, we first introduce ourselves to it. There are different programs that we needed, and we had to install them and start to control them.

### Sound Detector \(Sybren\)

Reading out sound signals and Reading clap

### QR Reader \(Sybren\)

Scan QR Code's 

### Cognex Camera \(Nacho\)

Install neccessary software from COGNEX website \(In-Sight Explorer 4.9.3\)

Set up the camera in a tripod so that we can keep it in the same position.

Study the different kind of lenses available and select the best one for this application.

### Project plan \(Nacho and Jaime\)

Outlook Calendar organization, distrubution of tasks depending on student background.

### Motion sensor \(Colin\)

Looking for some good example code from the kinect on windows forums. testing different environments to code in.

## Week 7.

### Allbot \(Nicolas & Jaime\)

We design how is going to be the maze, and we decided to put the camera in the top of the robot instead of install three different cameras in the maze. We get the IR transmitter and we tried to connect to the Allbot but without exit.

### Backend \(Sybren\)

Learn the new environment of NodeJS en setup the backend to recieve all of the data. 

Setup a Database in Mongoose for NodeJS

### RFID Reader \(Sybren\)

Scan QR Code's 

### Network \(Sybren\)

Setup the network envirement and configure DHCP Leases

### Schematics  \(Sybren\)

Desing the first scematic of the porject plan

### Insight explorer \(Nacho\)

Whole configuration of Insight explorer, detecting different shapes. We started detecting different random objects, and finally defined the objects that we use in the scape room.

Seting up outputs, from I/O Module. We connected the module and created an electrical box to be able to control it easily.

Communicate cognex camera - I/O Module - Raspberry Pi. We also connected the Raspberry Pi 3B to the Cognex Module so that they can communicate each other.

### Motion sensor \(Colin\)

Start with coding and adding different body positions to a personal library.

## Week 8.

Winter break.

## Week 9.

### Allbot \(Nicolas & Jaime\)

We were able to connect to the Allbot. We started with the programming of the Raspberry Pi to stream the image, and we tried to do it with the Raspberry Pi Zero, but it didn't work, so we had to do it with a Raspberry Pi 3. It makes a big difference, since the Pi Zero is much more lightweight, so it  is easier for the robot to carry it. For the demo the robot will carry a Pi 3, but it is suposed to carry a Pi Zero when using it in the maze of the Escape Room. We printed a guide for the users of the app, so it is easier to control the robot. 

### Backend \(Sybren\)

Learn the new environment of NodeJS en setup the backend to recieve all of the data. 

Setup a Database in Mongoose for NodeJS

### Frontend \(Sybren & Colin\)

#### Sybren

Researche of diffent frontend frameworks, and decided to go for ReactJS. 

Display al the data from the backend on the screen and display the camera image of the allbot.

#### Colin

 Researche in ReactJS and filtering the Database Query 

### RFID Reader \(Sybren & Nacho\)

#### Sybren

Send the RFID code to the Backend 

#### Nacho

Setup the Demo Questions for the Escape Room. In this case we decided to hide the rfid cards in books so that they will give a hint to the user when they find them. The result of the program is an String sent to Backend and seen in Frontend.

### Network \(Sybren & Nacho\)

Keep the network up to date with the new devices 

#### Nacho

Set up new end point and connect wifi. We found a new endpoint so we set it up to all devices. This way we can communicate with the server without any ethernet cable. Every device has its own IP.

### Schematics  \(Sybren\)

Desing the first scematic of the porject plan.

### Cognex Camera \(Nacho\)

Send data to Backend. We made a code so that the questions begin to appear on the screen and it is when you place the correct object behind the camera when you go to the next one until the end.

### QR Reader \(Nacho\)

Set up demo questions and send data to Backend. We made a code so that it is continously trying to detect a QR Code and when it is the correct one, the Raspberry Pi will send the data to Backend. This way, you will be able to go to next puzzle.

### Motion sensor \(Colin\)

Adding the semaphore alphabet and sending data to server.

## Week 10.

### Allbot \( Nicolas & Jaime\)

We had little problems when we tried to stream the image from the Pi 3, but we solved them and now the Allbot carries a Raspberry that streams the image. We printed a case for the Pi 3, so the image will be stable. 

### Motion sensor \(Colin\)

fixing some little bugs and changing the arms.

## Week 11.
