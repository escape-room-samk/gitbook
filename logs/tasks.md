# Tasks

## Week 6. 

\[04/02/2018-04/02/2018\]

### Allbot \( Nicolas & Jaime\)

In the first week, we receive the project, made a brainstorming to see what ideas can be done and we select the best ones. We divided the tasks and the puzzles. As the Allbot uses Arduino, we first introduce ourselves to it. There are different programs that we needed, and we had to install them and start to control them.

### Sound Detector \( Sybren\)

Reading out sound signals and Reading clap

### QR Reader \( Sybren\)

Scan QR Code's 

## Week 7.

### Allbot \( Nicolas & Jaime\)

We design how is going to be the maze, and we decided to put the camera in the top of the robot instead of install three different cameras in the maze. We get the IR transmitter and we tried to connect to the Allbot but without exit.

### Backend \( Sybren\)

Learn the new environment of NodeJS en setup the backend to recieve all of the data. 

Setup a Database in Mongoose for NodeJS

### RFID Reader \( Sybren\)

Scan QR Code's 

### Network \( Sybren\)

Setup the network envirement and configure DHCP Leases

### schematics  \( Sybren\)

Desing the first scematic of the porject plan

## Week 8.

Winter break.

## Week 9.

### Allbot \(Nicolas & Jaime\)

We were able to connect to the Allbot. We started with the programming of the Raspberry Pi to stream the image, and we tried to do it with the Raspberry Pi Zero, but it didn't work, so we had to do it with a Raspberry Pi 3. It makes a big difference, since the Pi Zero is much more lightweight, so it  is easier for the robot to carry it. For the demo the robot will carry a Pi 3, but it is suposed to carry a Pi Zero when using it in the maze of the Escape Room. We printed a guide for the users of the app, so it is easier to control the robot. 

### Backend \(Sybren\)

Learn the new environment of NodeJS en setup the backend to recieve all of the data. 

Setup a Database in Mongoose for NodeJS

### Frontend \(Sybren & Colin \)

#### Sybren

Researche of diffent frontend frameworks, and decided to go for ReactJS. 

Display al the data from the backend on the screen and display the camera image of the allbot.

#### Colin

 Researche in ReactJS and filtering the Database Query 

### RFID Reader \( Sybren & Nacho\)

#### Sybren

Send the RFID code to the Backend 

#### Nacho

Setup the Demo Questions for the Escape Room

### Network \(Sybren & Nacho \)

Keep the network up to date with the new devices 

### Schematics  \(Sybren\)

Desing the first scematic of the porject plan

## Week 10.

### Allbot \( Nicolas & Jaime\)

We had little problems when we tried to stream the image from the Pi 3, but we solved them and now the Allbot carries a Raspberry that streams the image. We printed a case for the Pi 3, so the image will be stable.
