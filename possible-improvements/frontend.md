# Frontend

For the frontend in this project we had to rush everything a bit because we started too late on this part of the project. At this moment if you completed a puzzle of the room you had to begin the next puzzle straight away sometimes without knowing exactly what to do. If we would improve the frontend we would be able to make the interface nicer and make it easier to find everything.
